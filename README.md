This project applies various metaheuristics to the airport gate assignment problem with time windows formulated by Lim et al in 2005 [1]. The study is conducted as part of the advanced seminar "Scheduling with Metaheuristics" at the chair of Operations Management of the TUM School of Management.

The following algorithms are used:
* Tabu Search
* Genetic Algorithm
* Memetic Algorithm
* Bee Colony Optimization

Their performance is compared to the commercial solver Gurobi.
