This project applies various metaheuristics to the airport gate assignment problem with time windows formulated by Lim et al in 2005 [1]. The study is conducted as part of the advanced seminar "Scheduling with Metaheuristics" at the chair of Operations Management of the TUM School of Management.

The following algorithms were implemented in Python 3.7.5 with numpy 1.17.4 and numba 0.46.0:
* Tabu Search
* Genetic Algorithm
* Memetic Algorithm
* Bee Colony Optimization

Their performance is compared to the commercial solver Gurobi.
